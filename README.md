# PyRubiks
The 3x3 Rubik's Cube in Python + Ursina Graphics


In CubeList: Index0=Front, Index1=Right, Index2=Back, Index3=Left, Index4=Up, Index5=Down

.Cube returns The Full Cube with Complex Color Structure of Each Face while .Faces returns The Cube's Faces with Simple Color Structure

Complex Color Names Follow Same Logic: ["WOB", "WB", "WRB"] => [W is Front, O is Left, B is Up], [W is Front, B is Up], [W is Front, R is Right, B is Up]

The buttons (while using the ursina graphics) can be repositioned by holding left shift and dragging them around
